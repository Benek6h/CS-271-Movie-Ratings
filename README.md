In order to run the code; you must follow the next steps:

1) Create a Virtual Enviroment
2) Install the following libraries:
    - Pandas
    - Numpy
    - XGTBoost
    - sklearn
    - NetworkX
3) Alternatively you may install from the provided requirements.txt

4) In order to run the model go to "MovieRatingPrediction.py" and then run it
5) Obtain the results!

Introduction to Data:
1) The data folder contains the data obtained from MoiveLens 1M data set in Kaggle
2) Divided into three different files; they are then properly merged on the python file
3) From there the graphs are created

Introduction to Results:
  The results are the following:
    1) A Bipartite Graph (subset of 100 on current version)
    2) Histogram of Movie Degree Distributions
    3) Scatter Plot of User vs Average Rating
    4) RMSE, ROC and F1 score results for each of the models.
